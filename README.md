# Unexpected Tailwind CSS behavior with certain components
This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered while using Tailwind CSS classes with a particular component. The issue appears to be related to the interaction between specific Tailwind classes and the component's structure.

## Bug Description
The bug is observed when applying specific Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `bg-gray-100`, `p-4`, `text-xl`, `font-bold`) to a component.  The styles are not applied as expected, and the component appears differently than intended.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm run dev` (requires a development server setup)
4. Observe the unexpected styling of the component.

## Solution
The solution involves [explanation of the solution. For example: Correctly applying Tailwind classes by ensuring they are correctly included in the component's structure. This might involve re-ordering classes, adding appropriate parent elements, or checking for conflicting styles.]

## Additional Notes
This issue may be specific to the particular component used. It could also relate to conflicts with other CSS or frameworks in use.
